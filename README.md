# README Generator- Alex Purfield

# Description
For Module 9 challenge we are using our new skills with node.js to create a command-line application that asks the user questions (using Inquirer) and takes the users answers to generate a high-quality README md file. The hope for this application is that it will allow the user to spend more time on their project and less time on the README file. 


# Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
* THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
* WHEN I enter my project title
* THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
* WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
* THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
* WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
* THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
* WHEN I enter my GitHub username
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
* WHEN I enter my email address
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
* WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
* THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

# Installation
To generate your own README, git clone the repo down to your local so you have the Node project on your local.

Run npm i in your command line in order to install the Inquirer library.

The application will start by user running node index.js in the command line.

Inquirer will prompt you for your inputs from the command line.

Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'SAMPLEREADME.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.
